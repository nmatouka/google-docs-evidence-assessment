# Terms of Service — Evidence Assessment Add-on

**Last updated:** February 12, 2026

## Acceptance of Terms

By installing or using the Evidence Assessment Google Docs add-on ("the Add-on"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not install or use the Add-on.

## Description of Service

The Add-on provides tools for systematically assessing and documenting the evidence quality, agreement level, and confidence of claims within Google Docs. It inserts markers into documents, stores assessment metadata, generates evidence appendices, and exports assessment data.

## Use of the Add-on

You may use the Add-on for any lawful purpose, including personal, academic, governmental, and commercial use. You are responsible for the content of your documents and the accuracy of your assessments.

## Data and Privacy

The Add-on stores all data within your Google Doc using DocumentProperties. No data is transmitted to external servers. For full details, see our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## Intellectual Property

The Add-on is open source software. The source code is available at: https://github.com/neilmatouka/google-docs-evidence-assessment

## Disclaimer of Warranties

THE ADD-ON IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The Add-on is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). References to "IPCC-style" uncertainty communication describe the methodological framework and do not imply official endorsement.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADD-ON OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE ADD-ON.

Specifically, the authors are not liable for:

- Loss of data stored in DocumentProperties
- Unintended modifications to your documents
- Inaccurate or inappropriate assessment outputs
- Any decisions made based on the Add-on's outputs

## Document Modifications

The Add-on modifies your Google Docs by inserting superscript markers, generating appendix sections, and storing data in document properties. These modifications cannot be undone through Google Docs' native undo function. You are responsible for maintaining backups of important documents.

## Changes to These Terms

These Terms of Service may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted here with an updated date. Continued use of the Add-on after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## Termination

You may stop using the Add-on at any time by uninstalling it from your Google Workspace. Assessment data stored in your documents will remain unless manually deleted.
